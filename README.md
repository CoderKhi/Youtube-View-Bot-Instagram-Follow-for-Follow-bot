Inside of the if/elif statements, you must change it to your prefered parameters.
For example:

In the youtube bot, I would put my desired watch time, my desired view amount, and my video URL.
so like this:
bot = YoutubeBot(100, 40, "https://youtube.com/videourl");
In the instagram bot, I would put my desired follower amount and my username and password
Please do much automatically assume that I am storing your information or anything like that, because if you look into my code, you can see there is nothing "fishy" going on.
This is what it would look like:
bot = InstagramBot(100, "username here", "password here");
